Things that I want to add. I will delete added things and add new things as time goes.

**To do list**
-
- Some kind of level-boss level-rewards system. (Added Random level generation still working on  bosses and stuff.)
- Enemys and Player needs more different weapon styles. I have couple of different weapon styles in mind.I am going to add them soon.
- Powerups are weird. Speed one seems broken.I am going to change upgrade system soon. I want to make it like roguelike , maybe like 
Risk of Rain.
- Need bosses. Hardest part is visual design.
- Different enemy types.
- Scoreboard? 
- Need to improve menu UI.
- Some kind of stat system. Like Health , Damage , Critical Hit? ... New upgrade system will also need this.
- I want to change player sprite aswell.
