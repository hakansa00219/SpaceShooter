Things that I want to add.

**To do list**
-
- Randomized levels. Right now every level is the same but I do have different style of monster spawns. I just need to create
level randomizer and some kind of level-boss level-rewards system.
- Enemys and Player needs more different weapon styles. I have couple of different weapon styles in mind.I am going to add them soon.
- Powerups are weird. Speed one seems broken.I am going to change upgrade system soon. I want to make it like roguelike , maybe like 
Risk of Rain.
- Need bosses. Hardest part is visual design.
- Different enemy types.
- Scoreboard? 
- Need to improve menu UI.
- Some kind of stat system. Like Health , Damage , Critical Hit? ... New upgrade system will also need this.
- I want to change player sprite aswell.
